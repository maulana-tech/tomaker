# ATS deployment and lifecycle runbook

## Current deployment

The application targets `deployments/hedera-ats.json`, issued by the controlled
administrator on 13 September 2026. Deployment, seeding, fixed/variable
investments, order-book trading, liquidity and a real Privy investment have
confirmed receipts. See [OWNED_MARKET.md](deployments/OWNED_MARKET.md).

Historical coupon, revocation and maturity receipts belong to
`hedera-ats-previous.json` and `hedera-ats-short.json`. The new market's future
maturity has not occurred; all nine of its contracts are verified on Sourcify.

The fork tests below prove the same phases without a broadcast and need no key.
Run them before any change to `src/**` or `script/**`.

`DeployATS` issues a bond through the real factory, sets the coupon, grants KYC to
every participant and protocol contract, issues inventory into the adapter, and
funds principal and coupon reserves. A deposit buys real ATS tokens, `split`
mints PT/YT, upkeep claims the ATS coupon as cash, and maturity redemption
returns principal. An address without ATS KYC cannot enter, and revocation
blocks it again. One maturity and one set of decimals hold across the ATS bond,
adapter, strategy, SY, PT, YT, tokenizer, AMM, and orderbook. The manifest
round-trips: every key `ATSLifecycle` reads is written by `DeployATS._manifest`.

## Dependency setup

Pinned in `dependencies.lock.json`: solc `0.8.28`, OpenZeppelin `v5.0.2`
(`dbb6104ce834628e473d2173bbc9d47f81a9eec3`), forge-std `v1.9.7`
(`77041d2ce690e692d6e03cc812b57d1ddaa4d505`).

```bash
cd contracts
python3 scripts/install-deps.py   # clones at the locked refs; never resets an existing checkout
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=hedera_live forge build
```

`install-deps.py` fails loudly if an existing checkout is dirty or at a different
commit, rather than discarding local work. Resolve it by hand if that happens.

## Verify before spending anything

```bash
cd contracts
forge test                                    # offline contract checks
RUN_ATS_LIVE=true forge test                  # includes network-dependent fork checks
```

The live checks read Hedera testnet at a pinned block and need an
archive-capable RPC. They broadcast nothing. Run them after any change to
`src/**` or `script/**` and before every broadcast: they exercise the exact
`_deploy` and `runPhase` code paths the broadcast will use.

## Live deployment

Use `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=hedera_live` for all current testnet simulations and
broadcasts. This profile keeps solc 0.8.28, optimizer 200, and via-IR, but targets
Cancun. Live factory simulation at block 40454448 rejected Paris and Shanghai
execution with `NotActivated`. Historical fork success alone did not cover this.
The default Paris build does not reproduce the current market's bytecode. Use
this same Cancun profile for source verification and bytecode comparisons:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=hedera_live forge build
python3 scripts/check-deployed-bytecode.py --out /tmp/tomaker-bytecode-check.json
```

All nine toMaker contracts match with these settings; the recorded compiler
settings, source hashes, constructor arguments and runtime hashes are in
[`owned-bytecode.json`](deployments/evidence/owned-bytecode.json). Runtime
comparison accounts for compiler-declared immutable slots; creation bytecode is
compared exactly. Upstream ATS contracts require their own source artifacts.

Run the deployment/lifecycle tests against a freshly observed block as well:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=hedera_live RUN_ATS_LIVE=true ATS_FORK_BLOCK=<current-block> \
  forge test --match-contract '(ATSFactory|ATSLifecycle)Test' -vv
```


Fill `.env` from `.env.example`. The key never enters the repo or a chat message.

Two accounts are required and must differ: the issuer (`PRIVATE_KEY`) and the
buyer (`BUYER_ADDRESS`, with its own key for the trade and settle phases). Both
need testnet HBAR for gas.

### Timing constraints, enforced by the script

- `START_DELAY_SECONDS` >= 1. ATS bond initialization reverts
  `WrongTimestamp(startingDate)` unless the starting date is strictly greater
  than `block.timestamp`; the default of 60s absorbs broadcast latency.
- `RECORD_DELAY_SECONDS` > `START_DELAY_SECONDS`.
- `TERM_SECONDS` > `RECORD_DELAY_SECONDS + 300`. The coupon payment date sits
  300s after the record date.
- Coupon reserves can only be funded before the record date. Foundry broadcasts
  the script as separate transactions. The full deployment must finish before
  that deadline; simulation does not guarantee that broadcast timing will fit.
- The `seed` phase seeds PT-heavy (1200 PT / 800 SY), not 50/50. The AMM's first
  `addLiquidity` reverts `ExchangeRateBelowOne` when the SY rate is above 1, and
  a 50/50 seed sits exactly on the curve's `exchangeRate >= WAD` boundary. A live
  bond accrues every second, so the rate is usually above 1 by seed time.
  `ATSLifecycleTest.testSeedAfterBondStartRequiresPtHeavyLiquidity` pins this.
  Seeding before `startingDate` also works, but PT-heavy does not depend on
  sub-second timing.

### Main demo market

Use a term long enough for participants to try the active market.

```bash
cd contracts
set -a; source .env; set +a
export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=hedera_live
export MANIFEST_PATH=deployments/hedera-ats.json
export TERM_SECONDS=7776000          # 90 days
export RECORD_DELAY_SECONDS=3600     # coupon record date at +1h, payment at +1h05m
export START_DELAY_SECONDS=600      # allow time for simulation and broadcast

forge script script/DeployATS.s.sol:DeployATS \
  --rpc-url "$HEDERA_RPC_URL" \
  --broadcast --slow --gas-estimate-multiplier 200
```

`--slow` avoids Hedera's stale-nonce race; the gas multiplier covers Hedera's
different gas schedule. On success, commit `deployments/hedera-ats.json`: it is
the submission's address evidence and the frontend's configuration source.

Then run the phases. Each is a separate broadcast around real chain time; there
is no `vm.warp` on testnet.

```bash
PHASE=seed  forge script script/ATSLifecycle.s.sol:ATSLifecycle \
  --rpc-url "$HEDERA_RPC_URL" --broadcast --slow --gas-estimate-multiplier 200
```

| Phase | Key | When it may run |
|---|---|---|
| `seed` | issuer | before the record date |
| `trade` | buyer | any time before maturity |
| `coupon` | either | at or after the payment date (record delay + 300s) |
| `revoke` / `reinstate` | issuer | any time; this is the rejected-operation demo |
| `settle` | each account | at or after maturity |

Run `settle` once per account. `revoke` demonstrates a rejected
operation: the contract refuses a revoked holder, and `reinstate` restores it.

### Short-maturity settlement market

Maturity cannot be demonstrated on a 90-day market without faking a time jump.
Deploy a second, clearly-labelled market and record its settlement:

```bash
export MANIFEST_PATH=deployments/hedera-ats-short.json
export TERM_SECONDS=1800             # matures 30 minutes out
export RECORD_DELAY_SECONDS=1200     # record date +20m, payment +25m
export START_DELAY_SECONDS=900       # must exceed the ~6-8m deploy broadcast
# deploy, then: seed immediately, trade, coupon after +25m, settle after +30m
```

Set `START_DELAY_SECONDS` above the deploy broadcast time (about 6-8 minutes of
34 `--slow` transactions). The PT-heavy seed no longer needs to beat
`startingDate`, but a start delay shorter than the deploy hides that timing.

Show both addresses distinctly in the demo. Never imply the main market matured.

## Receipts to capture

For each market, record and keep with the manifest:

- chain ID (296) and the ATS factory, resolver, and security addresses
- the ATS version and commit the ABI came from: v4.1.0,
  `95c5bb7811422bbfae333d2a29489b10909a3dee`
- issuance transaction hash, and one hash per lifecycle phase
- bond starting date, maturity, coupon record and payment dates
- cash and bond decimals (6), SY/PT/YT decimals (18)
- expected versus observed balances for issuer and buyer across each phase
- solc version, optimizer settings, and the source commit deployed
- the explorer link for every address and hash

`DeployATS` writes most fields into the manifest. Its `status` field starts as
`addresses-only-until-receipts-verified`; after the phases ran, the shipped
manifests read `deployed-lifecycle-verified` (main) and
`deployed-lifecycle-settled` (short) with the transaction hashes and an
`lifecycleEvidence` map attached.
Foundry also writes the raw transaction records under `broadcast/`, which is
git-ignored; copy the hashes you need into the evidence record rather than
committing that directory.

## Asset labels and evidence

- The cash token is `sdUSD`, a testnet demonstration ERC-20 minted by
  `script/ats/DemoCash.sol`. It is not USDC and not redeemable. The manifest
  carries this as `cashLabel`.
- The coupon rate is a synthetic illustrative figure over a deliberately short
  window, stored with the bond's regulation notice
  "TESTNET DEMONSTRATION ONLY. No real security or investment offered."
  Do not present it as yield or APY.
- `BOND` in every downstream config is the settlement adapter, not the ATS
  security. `adapter.securityToken()` is the real ATS asset.
- Funds and liquidity are seeded testnet demonstration funds, not adoption.

## Collect block-pinned evidence after broadcast

Use `scripts/collect-ats-evidence.py` to read the deployed state. It never signs
or broadcasts. It refuses missing code, mismatched maturities or decimals, and
failed, unmined, unrelated, or newer-than-snapshot receipts. Each output is a new
file; existing evidence is never overwritten.

```bash
cd contracts
python3 scripts/collect-ats-evidence.py \
  --manifest deployments/hedera-ats.json --phase before-seed \
  --output deployments/evidence/before-seed.json

# Run the authorized seed broadcast, then supply EVERY transaction hash from it.
python3 scripts/collect-ats-evidence.py \
  --manifest deployments/hedera-ats.json --phase seed \
  --tx "$SEED_TX_HASH" --before deployments/evidence/before-seed.json \
  --output deployments/evidence/seed.json
```

Repeat `--tx` for each transaction in a phase. Capture before/after snapshots for
trade, coupon, and both settlement accounts. `--block NUMBER` permits a historical
snapshot if the RPC supports it. Balances and deltas are integer base units, with
token decimals stored beside them. A zero tracked cash delta proves conservation
across the listed addresses, not that each individual payment was correct.

The report preserves raw successful receipts, a pinned block hash, runtime code
SHA-256 digests, local compiler settings, dependency pins, and the local revision
at collection. The collection revision is **not** asserted to be the deployed
revision. Preserve deployment build inputs separately. Runtime digests are not
explorer source verification. Inspect the factory transaction inputs and issuance
events to establish ATS provenance. The collector does not label a lifecycle
complete just because supplied transactions succeeded.

Collector validation tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v
```
