        <h2>Current market parameters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bond:</strong> an ATS-issued ERC-3643 security. The issuer controls KYC; the
            market reuses those controls, so a wallet without ATS eligibility cannot deposit into
            SY or move PT/YT.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cash:</strong> sdUSD, a 6-decimal testnet demonstration token. It is not USDC,
            not redeemable, and minted only by the deployment for the demo.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decimals:</strong> 6 for the cash and the ATS bond, 18 for SY, PT, and YT, with
            rate math in 18-decimal WAD.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maturity:</strong> fixed per deployment and shown in the app. A separate
            historical short-maturity market demonstrates settlement after maturity; the current market has a 90-day term.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fees:</strong> the swap and orderbook taker fees are bounded and adjustable only
            by the configured admin; the TWAP window is 30 minutes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Verifying the deployment</h2>
        <p>
          The contracts are built reproducibly from the Foundry project. Dependencies are pinned in{" "}
          <code>contracts/dependencies.lock.json</code>, and the build inputs are recorded with the
          deployment evidence. All nine contracts of this deployment are verified on Sourcify
          (chain 296); earlier verification records apply to historical addresses. To verify a
          contract, run:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`forge verify-contract <address> <path/to/Contract.sol:Contract> \\
  --chain 296 --verifier sourcify`}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          A <code>match</code> means Sourcify recompiled the source and reproduced the deployed
          bytecode. Check the contract&rsquo;s HashScan page separately for its displayed verification status. Rebuild locally
          with <code>forge build</code> and compare against the recorded build inputs; the contracts
          repository is the source of truth for the deployed bytecode.
        </p>

        <h2>Admin surface</h2>
        <p>
          The contracts are <strong>non-upgradeable</strong>. The SY vault&rsquo;s strategy is bound
          immutably and its admin can only set a deposit cap; the AMM, tokenizer, and orderbook
          admins can set bounded, event-emitting fees. None of those controls can redirect holder
          balances, set the exchange rate, or mint. Details in{" "}
          <Link href="/docs/security">Security and risks</Link>.

      <div className="mt-8">
        <Callout label="Address drift">
          The app components use <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_*</code> configuration with the current manifest
          as their fallback. ATS factory and security provenance use that same checked-in deployment. If they ever disagree, the
          on-chain address in the manifest is authoritative.
