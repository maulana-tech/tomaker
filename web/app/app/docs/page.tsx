        summary="toMaker is a protocol on Hedera that takes a deposit earning interest and splits it into two tokens you can trade separately: one that locks in a fixed rate, and one that collects the interest as it comes in."

      <div className="docs-prose mt-8">
        <p>
          Start with something familiar. Put money in a savings account and you own two things at
          once: the money you put in (the <strong>principal</strong>) and the stream of interest it
          earns (the <strong>yield</strong>). The interest rate floats. Some months it pays more,
          some months less, and you have no say in it. As long as the two are bundled together, you
          hold both, whether you want both or not.
        </p>
        <p>toMaker unbundles them. A deposit is split into two tokens:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>PT (Principal Token)</strong> is the deposit itself. Each PT pays back exactly
            one dollar of principal on a fixed date, called the <strong>maturity</strong>. Until
            that date it sells for slightly less than a dollar, so buying PT and simply waiting
            earns a <strong>fixed</strong>, known return. No guessing about where rates go.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>YT (Yield Token)</strong> is the interest stream. It collects all the{" "}
            <strong>variable</strong> interest the deposit earns between now and maturity, and you
            can collect it as you go. When maturity arrives the stream ends, and from then on YT is
            worth nothing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Both tokens trade freely, which turns interest rates themselves into something you can
          take a position on. Think rates will fall? Buy PT and lock in today&rsquo;s rate. Think
          rates will rise? Buy YT and collect the upside.
        </p>

        <h2>The one rule everything follows</h2>
        <p>
          Splitting starts from <strong>SY (Standardized Yield)</strong>, which is simply your
          deposit in token form: a receipt that grows in value as interest accrues. The protocol
          keeps one value identity true:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>PT + YT = SY</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The equation is about value, not fixed token counts. If one SY share is worth R units of
          underlying, splitting it mints R PT and R YT face units. Before maturity, handing back
          equal PT and YT face amounts returns the corresponding SY shares at the current exchange
          rate. The split changes the packaging of the position, not its combined claim.
        </p>

        <h2>The first market</h2>
        <p>
          The live market wraps a <strong>tokenized bond</strong> (an ERC-3643 / ATS security
          token) in the SY vault. Cash you deposit is used to buy the bond through the{" "}
          <code>BondStrategy</code> adapter, and the bond&rsquo;s coupon and maturity cashflow is
          the yield being split. The rate toMaker reports is the SY vault&rsquo;s derived exchange
          rate, read straight from the strategy&rsquo;s holdings; no person sets it. Each market
          has a fixed maturity date. After settlement is ready, PT redeems through SY at the
          frozen rate, subject to available backing.
        </p>

          toMaker runs on Hedera <strong>testnet</strong> with a real ATS-issued bond and test-only
          sdUSD cash. It has <strong>not</strong> had a professional third-party audit, and the
          contracts cannot be changed after deployment, so a defect would be permanent. Treat it as
