        bond through the SY vault and gives you SY in return. SY is your deposit as a token: it

        Split your SY. The protocol locks it up and gives you equal amounts of PT and YT. You now
        hold the fixed side and the floating side of your own deposit as two separate tokens.

        a view, use the <strong>Trade</strong> page: sell your YT to keep only PT (a locked, fixed
        rate), or sell your PT to keep only YT (a bet that rates go up). You can also{" "}
        <strong>recombine</strong> equal PT and YT face amounts into SY shares at the live exchange
        rate any time before maturity.

          The testnet market is newly seeded, so the trading pool is still small. Depositing,
          splitting, collecting and redeeming work at any size. Trades, however, move the price
          sharply while the pool is shallow, so check the quoted price impact before swapping. See{" "}
