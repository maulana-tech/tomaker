# Three-minute hackathon demo

Open https://tomaker.hypersettle.workers.dev/privy.

1. **Explain the problem:** toMaker separates principal and yield exposure for a permissioned ATS bond. Privy lets users enter with email instead of installing an injected wallet or configuring Hedera manually.
2. **Sign in:** Click Continue with email and complete email verification, then close the wallet-creation success screen with All Done. Show the embedded address in the shared wallet button. This is authentication, not real-world KYC.
3. **Fund the demo wallet:** Request demo funding. The backend verifies the Privy token and embedded-wallet ownership, grants issuer-controlled test eligibility, and supplies sdUSD and HBAR. sdUSD is a testnet demonstration token, not USDC.
4. **Make a financial choice:** Enter 100 sdUSD and choose Fixed principal. Click Invest once; the deposit, split and YT sale run as a visible sequence without a wallet prompt for each step. Each transaction confirms before the next, so a failure can leave a partial position. Explain the progress as depositing, separating exposure, and selling YT to retain PT. Exact approvals limit each requested allowance.
5. **Show the outcome:** Show the updated sdUSD, SY, PT and YT balances and download the investment receipts before navigating away. Fixed principal retains newly minted PT and sells newly minted YT; Variable yield does the reverse.
6. **Show public proof:** Visit Portfolio and Mint to demonstrate that the same Privy wallet follows the user, then open the downloaded receipts’ confirmed transactions on HashScan. Save the reviewed JSON for submission. A submitted hash alone does not prove successful execution.

All transactions use Hedera testnet, chain 296, with demo assets. The main market
has a 90-day maturity; do not present it as already redeemed. Existing short-market
evidence belongs to the earlier deployment and must be identified separately.

The implementation turns one UI investment action into a sequence of onchain
transactions that run after a single start; it is not an atomic batch. The optional PT exit is a scoped server-side
action: the user adds a Privy key quorum, the policy allows only the deployed
AMM's `swapPtForSy` up to 10 PT, and the server completes the exit without
another wallet popup. Gas sponsorship and atomic Hedera batching are not
implemented. A complete Privy-wallet investment demo requires a real user to
authenticate and approve; do not substitute an administrator transaction and
label it Privy evidence.

Before submission, provide source-code access, a short screen recording, and the
full reviewed receipt JSON. Never include private keys, Privy secrets or access
tokens in the recording or evidence.
